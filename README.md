# Democratic Backsliding in Europe
## Insights from the V-Dem Dataset

### Overview
This project explores democratic backsliding across the EU27 + UK & Switzerland, using data from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset and Eurostat. The analysis examines whether democracy is in retreat across Europe, identifies which countries are most affected, and investigates potential causes and mechanisms of democratic erosion.

### Key Findings
- Democratic decline is real but uneven
- Income inequality alone doesn't explain backsliding
- Polarization tracks with democratic erosion
- Executive aggrandizement varies across country
