    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nDemocratic backsliding is a broad concept that, at its core, refers to the state-led erosion of democratic institutions. As political scientist Nancy Bermeo observes in her 2016 paper “On Democratic Backsliding” “we now face forms of democratic backsliding that are legitimated through the very institutions that democracy promoters have prioritized.” Over the last decade, the phenomenon has gained prominence in the public debate, linked to populism, the far right, and authoritarianism (for example: “Liberal democracy vs. far‑right authoritarianism in Europe” — NYTimes, “What’s wrong with democracy in Europe?” — The Economist).\nWhat drives this erosion? Bermeo identifies two key mechanisms: (i) executive aggrandizement, i.e. the expansion of executive power beyond checks and balances and (ii) strategic electoral manipulation, e.g. restricting voter registration or changing electoral rules to favor incumbents. To these we might add (iii) civil society erosion, e.g. media censorship and restrictions on academic freedom. Several underlying causes have been proposed: (i) economic inequality and discontent; (ii) perceived socio-cultural threats, such as immigration or expanded rights for LGBTQ people and women; and (iii) culture wars and disinformation in an increasingly post-truth media environment.\nThis raises two questions: Is democracy truly in retreat? And is this driven by a single cause or by multiple interacting factors? I believe these questions are crucial for understanding the political landscape we live in and the choices we face as individuals and societies. This analysis explores possible answers by drawing primarily on the V-Dem dataset, with a particular focus on Europe (EU 27 + UK & Switzerland) in the last 20 years (2004 - 2024).",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe V-Dem dataset is one of the largest social science data collection projects on democracy, based at the University of Gothenburg. V-Dem provides 600+ indicators across all countries from 1789 to the present, measuring five high-level principles of democracy: electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian. Each principle is represented by an index and it is further broken down into components, each measured separately. Components (i.e. sub-indexes) include features such as free and fair elections, civil liberties, judicial independence and so on. Finally, each component is disaggregated into specific indicators (i.e. individual measurements or variables) (https://www.v-dem.net/about/v-dem-project/).\nThe dataset contains five key variable types based on their coding method:\nVariable Types in the V-Dem Dataset\nThe variables take the form of nominal (classifications, text, dates), numerical, ordinal (e.g., Likert-style scales), or interval scales (indexes) (Methodology).\nFurther metadata information: (i) the codebook explains each variable meaning, collection and coding, frequency and scale. Survey questions and answer options are detailed fully alongside the aggregation methodology across country expert (Codebook); (ii) the structure of aggregation document, i.e. the taxonomy of indexes, sub-indexes and indicators with codes (Structure of aggregation).\nIn the context of this work, I will concentrate on both indicators and indexes, to refer to higher level concepts, such as democracy rankings.\nThis analysis also makes use of macro-economic data from Eurostat, in particular the Gini coefficient for equivalised disposable income and real GDP per capita. Eurostat series presented some missing patterns, which I will adress in the following section.\nStructure of the dataset\nThe V-Dem top five indices measure five high-level principles of democracy: electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian. Each index is an aggregation of sub-index components and each sub-index is an aggregation of variables. Most variables derive from an aggregation of expert judgments for features of democracy that are not directly observable (C type of variables, please refer to table above) .\nThe most central index in the dataset is the Electoral Democracy index; it measures to what extent “elections are free, fair, and reoccurring; elected officials wield political power de facto; suffrage is universal; political parties and candidates can form freely and compete; and the environment around elections make for a reasonably level playing field with speech, media, and civil society freedom.” (25 Years of Autocratization – Democracy Trumped?)\nAs highlighted in the methodology document: “we consider this measure fundamental to all other measures of democracy: we would not call a regime without elections “democratic” in any sense”.(Methodology)\nHence, in the remainder of this analysis the Electoral Democracy Index will be used as a proxy for democratic health and democratic backsliding, whilst the other indices will be used sparsely with the purpose of adding further dimensions and color to this central one.\nV-Dem Dataset Structure: Indices, Sub-indices and Indicators\nCode\n#install.packages(\"collapsibleTree\")\nlibrary(collapsibleTree)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstructure_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/structure_of_aggregation_.csv\")\n\ncollapsibleTree(\n  structure_data,\n  hierarchy = c(\"High Level Index\", \"Low Level Index\", \"Indicator\"),\n  width = 1800,\n  height = 900,\n  fontSize = 10,\n  linkLength = 200,\n  zoomable = TRUE,\n  collapsed = TRUE,\n  root = \"V-Dem\",\n  nodeSize = \"leafCount\"\n)\nSource: (V-Dem Structure of Aggregation)",

For example, in a December 2024 paper(Income inequality and the erosion of democracy in the twenty-first century) Eli G. Rau & Susan Stokes note: “In the 21st century, democracy is more often threatened by elected presidents and prime ministers than by military coup-makers. What are the causes of this rise in democratic erosion? Cross-national statistical analysis points toward one robust finding: The more unequal income distribution is in a democracy, the more at risk it is of electing a power-aggrandizing and norm-shredding head of government.”\nAcross the EU27 + Switzerland (UK excluded due to missing Eurostat data), Gini coefficients and GDP per capita reveal a clear east-west divide. Western and Nordic countries are wealthier but more unequal; Eastern European countries are poorer but more equal. Notably, it is these more equal countries that have experienced the most democratic backsliding, contradicting the global pattern identified by Stokes & Rau, amongst others.\n\n\nCode\n#install.packages(\"eurostat\")\nlibrary(eurostat)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\n\n# Get Eurostat data listing\n#toc &lt;- get_eurostat_toc()\n\n# 1.

The heatmap reveals a clear pattern: countries ranking lowest on the Electoral Democracy Index (Hungary, Poland, Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia) show intensifying polarization across three different dimensions. These capture distinct but related phenomena: whether society is divided into antagonistic political camps (political polarization), whether major parties deploy hate speech in their rhetoric (political parties hate speech), and the extent to which differences of opinion result in major clashes of views (polarization of society). The visual evidence suggests that democratic backsliding and rising polarization tend to move together.\n\n\nCode\n#Polarisation\n#which(names(df) == \"v2cacamps\")\n\nEU_Dem_Polarize &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(country_name %in% EU27_List_UK_CH, year &gt;= 2003) |&gt;\n  select(country_name, year, \n         v2cacamps, v2smpolsoc, v2smpolhate, v2x_polyarchy) |&gt;\n  mutate(v2cacamps = v2cacamps * -1) |&gt;\n  group_by(country_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(poly_change_pct = (last(v2x_polyarchy) - first(v2x_polyarchy)) / first(v2x_polyarchy) * 100) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nEU_Dem_Polarize &lt;- EU_Dem_Polarize |&gt;\n  mutate(country_name = fct_reorder(country_name, -poly_change_pct))\n\nEU_Dem_Polarize_Long &lt;- EU_Dem_Polarize |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(v2cacamps, v2smpolsoc, v2smpolhate),\n               names_to = \"index_type\",\n               values_to = \"score\") |&gt;\n  mutate(index_type = recode(index_type,\n    \"v2cacamps\" = \"Political polarization\",\n    \"v2smpolsoc\" = \"Polarization of society\", \n    \"v2smpolhate\" = \"Political parties hate speech\"\n  ))\n\nggplot(EU_Dem_Polarize_Long, aes(x = year, y = country_name, fill = score)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"red\", mid = \"white\", high = \"blue\", midpoint = 0) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title = \"Less polarized ← → More polarized\",\n                               ticks = FALSE,\n                               label = FALSE,\n                               direction = \"horizontal\",\n                               title.position = \"top\",\n                               title.hjust = 0.5,\n                               reverse = TRUE)) +\n  facet_wrap(~index_type) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = NULL, x = NULL,\n       title = \"Measures of polarization across EU27 + UK & Switzerland\",\n       caption = \"Source: V-Dem\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 7),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        title = element_text(size = 12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCauses: Sociocultural threats Perceived socio-cultural threats - such as expanded equality across social groups and distrust towards pluralistic expression - have been proposed as drivers of democratic backsliding. The biplot maps six V-Dem indicators capturing both dimensions: educational equality, health equality, justice access, and power by gender on one hand; media perspectives and academic/cultural freedom on the other. PC1 (57.4% of variance) separates countries by overall performance: Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria cluster on the far right, scoring weakly across all indicators. PC2 (13.6%) distinguishes between equality-focused democracies (upper left: Germany, Slovenia, Switzerland scoring higher on education, health, justice) and freedom of expression-focused ones (lower left: Czechia, Ireland, France scoring higher on media perspectives and academic freedom). The backsliding democracies cluster away from all vectors, suggesting erosion occurs across both dimensions simultaneously rather than selectively.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(redav)\n\nEU_PCA_df &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(country_name %in% EU27_List_UK_CH, year == 2024) |&gt;\n  select(\n    country_name, year,\n    \"Academic and \\nCultural Freedom\" = v2clacfree,\n    \"Media Perspectives\" = v2merange,\n    #\"Elections Free/Fair\" = v2elfrfair,\n    \"Justice Access\" = v2xcl_acjst,\n    #\"Executive Respects Constitution\" = v2exrescon,\n    #\"Judicial\\nCompliance\" = v2jucomp,\n    \"Power by Gender\" = v2pepwrgen,\n    \"Educational Equality\" = v2peedueq,\n    \"Health Equality\" = v2pehealth\n  )\n\nScaled_EU_PCA_df &lt;- EU_PCA_df |&gt; \n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric) & !year, ~round((.x - mean(.x)) / sd(.x), 2)))\n\n# Remove year \npca_df &lt;- Scaled_EU_PCA_df |&gt; select(-year)\n\n# Biplot\ndraw_biplot(pca_df, \n            \"Power by Gender\",\n            label_size = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Dimensions of Perceived Socio-Cultural Threat\",\n       subtitle = \"Selected V-Dem indicators, 2024\",\n       caption = \"Source: V-Dem\"\n       ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanism In her paper “On Democratic Backsliding” Bermeo identifies two mechanisms of democratic erosion: executive aggrandizement and election manipulation. As Bermeo puts it: “Executive aggrandizement […] occurs when elected executives weaken checks on executive power one by one, undertaking a series of institutional changes that hamper the power of opposition forces to challenge executive preferences.” Whilst the definition of this phenomenon is complex and how best to measure it remains debated among scholars, this plot offers an exploratory look at five V-Dem indicators that align with Bermeo’s definition, each based on expert assessments: whether elections are free and fair, whether the executive respects the constitution, how often the government complies with court decisions it disagrees with, whether journalists are harassed by the government, and whether opposition parties can exercise oversight against the governing coalition’s wishes. Countries are ordered by their overall electoral democracy score. As expected, countries with lower democracy scores rank worse in every metric. Notably, election fairness and journalist harassment show the clearest gradient. The other indicators exhibit a more mixed picture.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nEU_aggrand_df &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(country_name %in% EU27_List_UK_CH, year == 2024) |&gt;\n  select(\n    country_name, year,\n    \"Electoral democracy score\" = v2x_polyarchy,\n    \"Elections Free/Fair\" = v2elfrfair,\n    \"Executive Respects Constitution\" = v2exrescon,\n    \"Judicial Compliance\" = v2jucomp,\n    \"Harassment of journalists\" = v2meharjrn,\n    \"Legislative opposition party\" = v2lgoppart\n  )\n\n# Create long format\nEU_aggrand_long &lt;- EU_aggrand_df |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -c(country_name, year),\n    names_to = \"indicator\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  )\n\n# Calculate deviation from median using z-scores\nEU_diverging &lt;- EU_aggrand_long |&gt;\n  group_by(indicator) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    deviation = (value - mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(value, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Create country order based on polyarchy score\ncountry_order &lt;- EU_aggrand_df |&gt;\n  arrange(`Electoral democracy score`) |&gt;\n  pull(country_name)\n\nEU_diverging &lt;- EU_diverging |&gt;\n  mutate(country_name = factor(country_name, levels = country_order))\n\n# Set indicator order with polyarchy first\nEU_diverging &lt;- EU_diverging |&gt;\n  mutate(indicator = factor(indicator, levels = c(\n    \"Electoral democracy score\",\n    \"Elections Free/Fair\",\n    \"Executive Respects Constitution\",\n    \"Judicial Compliance\",\n    \"Harassment of journalists\",\n    \"Legislative opposition party\"\n  )))\n\n# Plot\nggplot(EU_diverging, aes(x = deviation, \n                          y = country_name, \n                          fill = deviation &gt; 0)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~indicator) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"firebrick\", \"steelblue\"), \n                    labels = c(\"Below EU mean\", \"Above EU mean\")) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth = 0.3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 8)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Deviation from mean\", \n    y = NULL, \n    fill = NULL,\n    title = \"Executive Aggrandizement Indicators in the EU 27 + UK and Switzerland (2024)\",\n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem\"\n  ) +\ntheme(\n  plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1),\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 12)\n)",

    "text": "This analysis examined whether democracy is in retreat across Europe and what factors might be driving this erosion. Democratic backsliding in Europe is real but uneven. The sharpest declines are concentrated in post-communist countries—Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia. Yet established western democracies are not immune: democracy scores sit materially below their peaks everywhere, and polarization and political hate speech have intensified across the board. The causes appear multiple and context-dependent. Income inequality alone does not predict backsliding within the EU; the more equal post-communist democracies have experienced the sharpest declines. Wealth may be the missing variable: poorer countries with lower inequality have proven more vulnerable than wealthier, more unequal ones. Polarization shows a clearer association, with the worst-performing democracies also exhibiting the most intense political divisions. The mechanisms of erosion vary. Factors such as election fairness, journalist harassment, and other related measures serve as proxies for executive aggrandizement and show a consistent relationship with democratic health, whereas dimensions like judicial compliance, constitutional respect, and opposition oversight display a more mixed pattern. Executive aggrandizement does not follow a single template. Limitations apply: V-Dem relies on expert assessments, which can be subjective. Furthermore, democracy indices depend on factor selection and weighting criteria that can be biased.",
